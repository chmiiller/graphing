This page will help you on how to run the frontend of this repo

## Requirements

You will need to have NodeJS v14 and Yarn on your machine. With that, `cd` to `graphing/client` and run:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

So you're ready to go and the client should be running on  `http://localhost:3000`
