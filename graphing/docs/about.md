This repo is just a reference project made by me in order to understand and implement for the first time a GraphQL server and experiment a little bit on how to use it. Besides a GraphQL Server, this repo also has a React client using GraphQL + Apollo for queries and mutations.

## Reference

![project overview](/img/project_overview.png)
I've followed a 2018 YouTube playlist from [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) to build this project and had to update some of the client content in order to use hooks and functional components on React. On the server side I've to start using MongoDB Atlas instead of the legacy mLab.
